LAYOUT :
insert placeholder where content actually changes

yield whatever page we're on and shove it into where this yield


PUBLIC & PRIVATE

if we don't want the code that runs the page to be shown to everyone we want it to be private
sinatra already knows its private

html & css is all public code.

even though html is public everything in erb tags in the html file is private.
sinatra does have a way to declare public
